[Basic Git Terms]

Git is a version control system that tracks changes in your files and allows multiple people to collaborate on code.
Below are some key commands:

- Add: Stages changes (files you've modified or created) to be included in the next commit.
git add filename

- Commit: Records a snapshot of the staged changes with a message describing what you did.
git commit -m "Add feature"

- Push: Uploads your local commits to a remote repository like GitHub.
git push origin main

- Fetch: Downloads new data (commits, branches, etc.) from the remote repository but doesn't merge it into your local code yet.
git fetch

- Pull: Combines fetch and merge; it gets updates from the remote repo and merges them into your local branch.
git pull

- Reset: Reverts your branch or working directory to a previous state (undoing commits or staged changes).
git reset --hard <commit>

- Merge: Integrates changes from one branch into another.
git merge branch-name
